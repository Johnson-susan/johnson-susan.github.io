            <!-- A few things to note: 
                1) I have not solved the problem of "long s". I need a global encoding as there are way too many to encode on the phrase-level. 
                Consequently, this document ignores the issue and uses a modernized reading with "short s". 
                UPDATE- I was introduced to defaults today in WWP training, Fri oct 29, and I think I might be able to solve the problem in this way. 
                I will keep this in mind as I learn more.
                
                2) Pointing and linking: I included an identifer attribute in some elements, but am not pointing or linking to anything yet. 
                I have expereince with them in HTML, and they were introduced to us in class, but I had questions. However, my WWP training today 
                answered my questions so I can practice going forward. 
                
                3) Similarily, I just learned today about delimiters, after my encoding for these transcripts. Last session I learned about special unicode characters, 
                hard and soft hyphens. This is more complicated terriotry to figure out, so for out purpose I used lb to structure the line breaks.
                
                4) Further, today I was introduced to the nuanaces of emph, hi, and rend. I will be able to apply this as I learn more going forward.-->
